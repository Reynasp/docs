The Impact of BTS on Resolving the Problem of Youth Mental Health and How BTS is changing the world through their music

## Who is BTS?
BTS (Hangul: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan) is a 7 membered boyband that is currently at the peak of their career since they’re titled as biggest group in the world due to various international achievements and recognition that they have achieved, such as the award of the best artist, best album, best song and best group since 2017 in Korea, and has topped the billboard charts since 2017, earning the nickname of the best group and top artist in America since 2018 (BBC, 2018). However, debuting in 2013 under the auspices of the Big Hit Entertainment agency, BTS began their career as a group that did not have so many opportunities to appear on music shows due to the group's background as an artist who came out of a small agency namely Big Hit Entertainment, which is this agency not included in the ranks of large agencies such as SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment.


## How's it begin?

In 2013, a group of seven boys, all from different backgrounds, who left behind their friends and family to follow their dream of becoming K-pop artistes, were about to debut. But soon afterwards, their hopes were crushed as the bad press from the media, internal strife and lack of proper finance forced them to almost disband multiple times. But they kept on fighting for their dream, even if that meant living in one cramped dorm room and having to beg people to come to their concerts. These boys had very humble beginnings – one of the members, Yoongi, recently had a surgery to repair a torn shoulder labrum. The tear was related to an injury that occurred in 2012, when the performer was hit by a car during one of his delivery-boy shifts. 
Flash forward to years later, that same group of boys from South Korea, Bangtan Sonyeondan (BTS), are now one of the biggest boy bands in the world. Among other outstanding achievements, they have multiple No. 1 albums in the US Billboard Hot 100, 15 Guinness World Records and over 300 awards. BTS are the youngest recipients of South Korea's Order of Cultural Merit award and the first ever K-pop act to receive a Grammy nomination. They are changing the world and the face of K-pop forever, paving the way for others.

## Summary
Legacy and cultural impact

BTS have been described as "easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world" that can "do things no other name in their genre can", with Time giving them the nickname "Princes of Pop". Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable to and as influential as the Beatles and the Monkees. Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic." As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake. In 2020, BTS became the first non-western and non-English speaking artist to be named IFPI's Global Recording Artist of the Year. In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year.

The group's influence has led them to address the 73rd United Nations General Assembly and perform before 400 officials, including South Korean president Moon Jae-in, at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris, a summit celebrating the friendly relations between France and South Korea. That year, BTS also became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with over 15 years of notable achievements, President Moon recognized the group for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language worldwide. In September 2019, BTS were mentioned by President Moon in his announcement for his "3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry" for having pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans. In 2020, BTS were bestowed the James A. Van Fleet Award in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the promotion of US-Korea relations; to date, they are the youngest honorees and only musicians to receive the award in its history. In July 2021, they were appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture by President Moon. In their role as envoys, they help to "raise awareness on global agendas, such as sustainable development, to our future generations and to strengthen the nation's diplomatic power across the world" and represent South Korea at various international events, such as the 76th United Nations General Assembly.
